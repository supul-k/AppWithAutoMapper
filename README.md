# AutoMapper Integration in ASP.NET Core

This project demonstrates how to effectively use AutoMapper in an ASP.NET Core application to map between models and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) without manual mapping.

## Features

- Mapping between `User` entity and DTOs (`UserResponseDTO`, `UserRegisterDTO`).
- Centralized mapping configuration using AutoMapper profiles.
- Separation of concerns by using repositories for data access and AutoMapper for mapping.
- Exception handling for database operations.
